        <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
        <p>
          The idea of Unigigg.com initiated from a simple realization, “The real world is very different from what we learn in textbooks”. That is when we developed this platform to help the young talents to build up their career readiness through practical, real-world experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 2015 our cofounders Tayef and Rehan were fresh out of college. Like every other fresh graduates they started to look for jobs when they realized the stark difference between the university life and real life. Since then they have come up with this idea to help out students and young talents to get a taste of the real world through internships, part time jobs and eccentric jobs to make them career ready.
        </p>
        <h4>What we Do</h4>
        <p>
          Unigigg is on a mission for every young talent to embark on his or her job search with a Unigigg profile that showcases their unique set of experiences and skills. We also want to help employers to find the right fit for their organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users on the Unigigg platform can get their skills validated through showcasing their projects and taking online challenges etc. This helps the young talents to get hired for the jobs that best suit their skillset and also make them career ready through internships and part time jobs. The employers also get access to candidates that best fit their organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          We actively source a diverse variety of employers and opportunities to build our employer-talent community.
